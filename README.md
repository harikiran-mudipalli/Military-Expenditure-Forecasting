## Abstract
Over time, military expenditure is periodically increasing worldwide. In 2020 data, it has reached around $1981 billion USD, the highest number since 1988. Given the current geopolitical situation, most countries around the globe are planning to renew their military expenditure budget. Even Germany is committing 100 billion euros $112.7 billion) to invest in its military services. In this project, we tried to predict the
precise time-series model by exploring data on the dataset combined from SIPRI (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute), nuclear weapon, and CNTS
(cross-National Time-Series) datasets. The topmost countries were evaluated over the period to see the pattern, and trend over the years. We used Facebookâ€™s Prophet time-series model for optimal forecasting. This model will predict the military expenditure of the top countries for up to next five years.
